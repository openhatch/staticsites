<h2>Why do it?</h2>

<p>Open source software like Linux and Firefox are used by hundreds of millions of people.
This event is the fast track to participating.</p>

<p>If you come out on Saturday, we'll teach you how the community works. You'll get to play with
essential tools like version control and IRC chat.</p>

<h2>What are we doing?</h2>

<p>In the morning, after coffee and breakfast, we'll have three introductory tutorials:</p>
<li>Introduction to Open Source Communication Tools</li>
<li>Introduction to the Command Line</li>
<li>Introduction to Version Control Using Git</li>
<p>We'll share lunch, and then afterwards you'll work with mentors to pick an open source project, find a bug to fix, and make a contribution.</p>
<p>Coffee will be out at 9am, tutorials start at 10am, and the workshop will go until 5pm.</p>


<h2>Can anyone sign up?</h2>

<p>You have to be a student at Harvard University to attend. (If you want to run a similar event
at a different college, email us at <strong>events@openhatch.org</strong>.)</p>

<p>We're looking for people who like technical crafts that
scale well across the Internet. That usually means software programming, user interface design,
technical writing, and testing. And we're looking for people who are enthusiastic!</p>
