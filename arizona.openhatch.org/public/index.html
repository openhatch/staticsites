	                <h2>The Background</h2>

	                <p>Students like you around the world are gaining
	                valuable experience, connections, and skills by
	                coding, testing, and writing for free software
	                projects like Firefox, WordPress, Wikipedia's backend
	                code, and SAGE.</p>

	                <p>You do <em>not</em> need to know how to program to
	                contribute to free software. You can contribute code,
	                but also original art, testing, documentation, web
	                design, and much more. All levels of skill and experience
                        are welcome.</p>

                <h2>More about open source</h2>
                <p>Free, open source software is software that is
                shared freely and available to build upon. It is a
                great way to apply your skills to real-world projects
                and social causes. You can participate by writing or
                reviewing code, answering users' questions,
                translating the interface to another language, making
                video tutorials to help new users, and myriad other
                ways. Open source software is often produced by lots
                of people collaborating across time and space, and
                this event specially welcomes newcomers to that style
                of development.</p>

                <p>Open source participation is one way to gain
                real-world skills and make connections that will last
                you through your career. Volunteer staff will include
                professionals and academics who use open source
                daily.</p>
