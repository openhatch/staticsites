<h2>Open source comes to campus</h2>

<p>We're free software enthusiasts.</p>

<p>We want Philadelphia college students to have the community knowledge and technical skills to participate in
globally distributed software projects: Big ones, like
<a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox</a> and 
<a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>, and small ones, like
<a href="http://pyblosxom.bluesock.org/">PyBlosxom</a> and
<a href="http://rephial.org/">angband</a>.</p>

<p>Does that sound cool? We'll teach you.</p>
<p>You do <b>not</b> need to know how to program to contribute to free software. You can contribute code, but also original art, testing, documentation, web design, or anything else.</p>

<h2>Small-group learning</h2>

<p>On <strong>Saturday, Sep 25</strong>, we'll teach 20 college students.</p>

<p>We'll take you to a local <b>restaurant for lunch</b> and give you hands-on sessions where you learn
about open source licensing, collaboration tools, and how free software projects
are organized.</p>

<p>Space is <b>very</b> limited, so we'll focus on people with a real interest in learning. You must apply for a spot by sending us an email. Don't delay!</p>

<h2>Build things</h2>

<p>On <strong>Sunday, Sep 26</strong>, we invite you to an
open "hack" session. ("Hacking" is a good thing!)</p>

<p>Everyone is welcome, no signup needed, although a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=109664059095389">Facebook RSVP</a> would be cool!</p>

<p>If you're not sure what to work on, we'll step you through
how to modify programs like Firefox and the GIMP image editor
and help you find a project idea.</p>

<p>We'll have community members representing a bunch of
open source projects hanging around, helping out. And
we'll <strong>feed you lunch</strong>.</p>
