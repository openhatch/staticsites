  <h2>The Background</h2>
  <p>
    Students like you around the world are gaining valuable
    experience, connections, and skills by coding, testing, and
    writing for free software projects like Firefox, WordPress,
    Wikipedia's backend code, and SAGE.</p>

  <p>You do <em>not</em> need to know how to program to contribute to
    free software. You can contribute code, but also original art,
    testing, documentation, web design, or anything else. We want to
    teach you how to join them.</p>

  <h2>The event</h2>
  <p>On <strong>Saturday, April 6</strong>, we want to bring you up to speed on open
  source projects and help you contribute to a real community.</p>
  <p>In the morning, we'll teach you about open source licensing,
    collaboration tools, and how free software projects are
    organized.</p>
  <p>In the afternoon, we'll help you make contributions to open source
  projects.</p>
  <p>We'll also feed you, get to know you, and talk with you about opportunities for students in open
  source.</p>
  <p>The event will run from <strong>10am to 5pm</strong> at <strong>Science Center E111 and the Microfocus</strong>.</p>
  <p><strong>Sign up for our wait-list and post-event follow-up info!</strong>  For now, we have have reached our maximum capacity, but
we will let you know as soon as possible if there is room for you.  We will also be sending out an email after the
event with links to video, slides and texts of presentations, as well as guides to finding projects to contribute to, and contact information for the staff.  If you sign up, you will receive that email regardless of whether or not you were able to attend the event.</p>

  <h2>More about open source</h2>
  <p>Free, open source software is software that is shared freely and
    available to build upon. It is a great way to apply your skills to
    real-world projects and social causes. You can participate by writing
    or reviewing code, answering users' questions, translating the
    interface to another language, making video tutorials to help new
    users, and myriad other ways. Open source software is often produced
    by lots of people collaborating across time and space, and this event
    specially welcomes newcomers to that style of development.
  </p>
  <p>
    Open source participation is one way to gain real-world skills and
    make connections that will last you through your career. Volunteer
    staff will include professionals and academics who use open source
    daily.
